		"Harnessing the raw energy of the mundane world and converting it into Vis has always been a tantalizing challenge for thaumaturges. ",
		"The Vis Generator is an ingenious device that bridges the gap between mechanical power and magical energy, transforming common fuels into usable Vis to replenish your local aura. ",
		"This technology is particularly useful for thaumaturges operating in areas with depleted Vis levels or for powering demanding magical constructs and devices.",
		"",
		"However, such power comes with risksâ€”overloading the generator or neglecting its balance may lead to dangerous Flux buildup."
