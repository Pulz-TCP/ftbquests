		"While exploring the eldritch corners of the world, youâ€™ve encountered strange, hostile figures clad in deep crimson robes. These Crimson Cultists, as they are called, appear to worship something ancient and alien, a power beyond the comprehension of most thaumaturges. Among their possessions lies an ominous artifact: Crimson Rites, a forbidden tome filled with dark rituals, ancient symbols, and cryptic passages.",

The knowledge it contains will grant you immense power, but at a terrible cost. To wield such power is to risk your very sanity and invite the attention of eldritch forces that may seek to consume you.",
