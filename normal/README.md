## Quickstart guide (WIP)

- Create a SinglePlayer world with cheats enabled and enter Creative Mode (So mobs ignore you)
- Give yourself a Quest Book
- Enter editing mode with /ftbquests editing_mode
- The + button at the top left creates a new quest, you can right click this for options
- Right-click on any chapter, quest, task or reward to open context menu from where you can edit objects, delete, move, etc.
- To make quest A depend on quest B, select quest B and `Right-click` on quest A and click `Add selected quest as dependency`. To remove it, click `Remove selected quest from dependencies` instead.
